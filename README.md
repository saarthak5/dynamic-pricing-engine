# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots
Urban parking spaces are a limited and highly demanded resource. Prices that remain static throughout the day can lead to inefficiencies â€” either overcrowding or underutilization. To improve utilization, dynamic pricing based on demand, competition, and real-time conditions is crucial.
This project simulates such a system: an intelligent, data-driven pricing engine for 14 parking spaces using real-time data streams, basic economic theory, and ML models built from scratch.

## Tech Stack
This project uses only basic python libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib for plotting and visualizations.

## Usage
To generate prices for each timestamp and visualize the results, run:
```
python main.py
```

## Future Work
Simulate real-time data ingestion and pricing using Pathway.
